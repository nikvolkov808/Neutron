# Neutron Desktop Environment
### About
> This project aims to provide an exstensible desktop environment powered by electron and all sorts of web-based technologies; the possibilities are practically endless.
--- 
# Standout Features (Planned)
### Theming support
> By using a template system for system customization we can hot-swap our system's appearence in a matter of seconds.
> I am considering adding a built-in theme browser, but this will require donation support that I am not asking for right now. This theme browser will be a later addition.
### Settings Management
> Ever wish there was a way to revert to your old setup when things break? Well, when you confirm an alteration to your settings the old ones will be stored for safe keeping.
> You can always load these old settings by pressing the shortcut to do specifically this with: CTRL+MOD+SHIFT+U for "undo". This will always restart your current session with the old settings applied.
> In the event of settings breaking, the default config will load.


### THIS PROJECT IS NOT VAPORWARE, I AM JUST ONE PERSON AND I HAVE A LIFE OUTSIDE OF PROGRAMMING
